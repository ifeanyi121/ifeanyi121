# Hey there! 👋

I'm [Ifeanyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/obi2), a computer engineer and data scientist.

I build things that solve real problems from edge AI systems to browser extensions.

If I see an interesting problem, I'll probably try to build a solution for it.

My main tech stack is Python, PyTorch, JavaScript, and SQL. My favorite tools are VS Code, Power BI, and Jupyter notebooks.

I'm currently researching lightweight CNN architectures for real-time driver safety monitoring , making models small enough to run on a Raspberry Pi.


**Fun Facts:**
- 🎓 Finishing my MS in Computer Science at Marshall University (Dec 2025)
- 🔬 I enjoy optimizing models until they run on the smallest hardware possible
- 📊 I can spend hours making a dashboard look just right
- ⚡ Hobbies: competitive programming, learning new frameworks, building side projects
